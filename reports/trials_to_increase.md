# Suggestions: under-tested higher-distance candidates

Rule used for the website: for each **[[n,k]]**, we display the entry with the **largest number of distance trials**.

This report lists cases where another entry has a **larger distance** but **fewer trials** than the displayed one.
Those are good candidates to re-run with more trials.

No under-tested higher-distance candidates found.
